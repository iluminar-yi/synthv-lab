# SynthV Lab

This repo is where people can try out different techniques and explore limits of [Synthesizer V (SynthV)](https://synthesizerv.com/).

This work uses [`synthv-utils`](https://github.com/iluminar-yi/synthv-utils) to facilitate production and
to prettify the `.s5p` project file to make it more readable.
